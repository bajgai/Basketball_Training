# Basketball Training

## Project Overview

A structured basketball shooting drill program based on Stephen Curry's workout routines. The project starts as curated documentation and is designed to evolve into an app or website.

## Current Phase

**Research & Documentation** — Analyzing YouTube videos of Curry's shooting routines to build a comprehensive 1-hour shooting drill program.

## Source Material

- 4 YouTube videos (links to be provided) covering Stephen Curry's shooting drills and workout routines
- Transcripts and frame-by-frame analysis of key techniques

## Output Format

- Structured markdown files designed for future migration to an app/website/database
- Each drill should include: name, duration, reps, court positioning, technique notes, and progression levels

## Tech Stack

- None yet — markdown documentation only
- Git + GitHub for version control and backup
- Future: potential web app or mobile app build

## Workflow

1. User provides YouTube video links
2. Analyze transcripts and video content
3. Ask user clarifying questions per drill (skill level, court access, equipment)
4. Create structured 1-hour shooting routine in markdown
5. Back up to GitHub
