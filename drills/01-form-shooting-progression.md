# Form Shooting Progression

> Source: Curry MasterClass, Brandon Payne Offseason Workout

## Overview

The foundation of every Curry workout. Start close to the basket and work outward, building confidence and calibrating mechanics before any perimeter shooting. Curry does this drill at the start of **every single workout and pregame**.

## Setup

- **Equipment:** Ball, hoop
- **Court:** Half court (any basket)
- **Players:** 1 (solo-friendly using self-toss)

## Structure

### 5 Angles Around the Basket

1. Right side of the rim
2. Right wing
3. Top of the key
4. Left wing
5. Left corner

### 4 Distances at Each Angle

Start directly at the rim and step back after each set of 5 makes:

1. Right at the rim (~3 feet)
2. Short range (~6 feet)
3. Mid-range (~10 feet)
4. Extended mid-range (~15 feet)

### Reps

- **5 perfect makes** at each distance before stepping back
- 5 makes x 4 distances x 5 angles = **100 total perfect makes**

## Technique Cues

### Feet (Ground Up)
- 10 toes facing the rim (slight 10-15 degree natural offset is OK, but both feet point the same direction)
- Feet shoulder-width apart
- Knees behind toes — load into hips and glutes, NOT the knees
- "Find your arch" — plant the arch of your foot into the ground
- No valgus (knees caving in) or knees bowing out
- Heels light — weight on balls of feet

### Hands
- Ball sits on fingertip pads, NOT the palm
- Small space between palm and ball
- Find the air valve — place index/lead finger directly on it to center your hand

### Eyes
- Lock onto the front of the rim where the hooks attach the net
- 2-3 hooks are always facing you (about the width of a basketball)
- This target reminds you to shoot with arc (ball traveling DOWN into the basket)

### Release
- Elbow above eye on follow-through
- Full extension — "gooseneck" finish, fingers pointing into the basket
- Ball path: from hip, up through the right side of the body, through eyebrows, into release
- NEVER bring the ball through the center of your body or under your chin
- Aim for 45-48 degree arc

### Power
- **Shoot from the ground up** — legs provide the power, not the arms
- Hips loaded, knees behind toes, weight in glutes
- Drive through the ground, straight up and down

## Solo Adaptation (Self-Toss)

When alone with no rebounder:
- Toss the ball out to yourself with backspin to simulate a pass
- Catch in shot-ready position and shoot
- Larry Bird tip: try to hit back of rim so ball rolls back to you

## Common Errors to Watch

| Error | What Happens | Fix |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| Fanning | Follow-through goes sideways, ball drifts right | Keep fingers aimed at the basket |
| Thumbing | Thumb pushes ball, causes left-right action | Thumb stays passive on guide hand |
| One-eyed shooting | Arm covers one eye | Be a "two-eyed shooter" — see both eyes from the side |
| Flat shot | Chicken wing / elbow too low | Elbow above eye on release |
| Dipping | Catching high then dropping ball before shooting | Maintain catch level, don't dip more than 1-2 inches |

## Diagnosing Misses

- **Missing left/right:** Mechanical problem — check the chain from feet to release
- **Missing short/long:** Touch/rhythm issue — usually means not using legs (fatigue or laziness)
- **Short misses are acceptable. Left/right misses signal something is broken.**

## Progression Levels

| Level | Target |
|-------|--------|
| Beginner | 50 makes (5 makes x 2 distances x 5 angles) |
| Intermediate | 100 makes (5 makes x 4 distances x 5 angles) |
| Advanced | 100 makes with no mechanical breakdown under fatigue |
