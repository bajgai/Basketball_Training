# Stationary Ball Handling Foundation

> Source: Curry MasterClass Parts 1 & 2

## Overview

Master the three fundamental dribble moves that Curry uses "99% of the time" in games. Every combination and every creation of space is built from these three moves. This is done before any shooting as part of the warm-up.

## Setup

- **Equipment:** 1 basketball (no hoop needed)
- **Court:** Any flat surface
- **Players:** 1

## The Three Moves

### 1. Crossover
- Ball crosses in front of the body from one hand to the other
- Nose moves only slightly — no weight shift side to side
- Shoulders turn, but feet stay stationary

### 2. Between the Legs
- Drive ball under the hamstring (NOT under your butt) — shortest distance
- Minimal shoulder turn
- OK to pick up the heel slightly
- Off-hand just hangs and waits for the ball

### 3. Behind the Back
- Ball goes right underneath the hamstring/behind the knee — NOT a wrap-around
- Same movement concept as a crossover, just behind the body
- Off-hand hangs and waits for the ball
- Keep nose centered, don't turn the body

## Rep Structure

### Phase 1: Single Moves
- 20 reps on each side (right-to-left, then left-to-right)
- For each of the 3 moves = **120 total dribbles**

### Phase 2: Decreasing Reps
- 6 reps of each move on each side
- Then 2 reps of each
- Then 1 rep of each

### Phase 3: Combinations
- String all 3 moves together in sequence
- 6 reps of the full combination
- Then 2 reps
- Then 1 rep

## Technique Cues

### Body Position
- Nose behind toes
- Hips loaded (same athletic stance as shooting)
- Ball height: between knee and hip (same height as your shot pocket)
- Eyes UP — never look at the ball
- Feet stationary, shoulder-width apart

### Dribble Intensity
- HARD, aggressive pound into the ground
- Minimize time the ball is in the air
- Fingertip pads, not palming
- Ball stays OUTSIDE your feet, never inside

### Core Principle
> **Move the ball around your body, not your body around the ball.**

At any moment during any of the three moves, you should be able to bring the ball directly into your shot pocket. If you can't, readjust your position.

## Common Mistakes

- Dribbling inside your feet
- Eyes down watching the ball
- Soft/lazy dribble
- Nose moving outside the frame of the body
- Ball driven too far back (under butt instead of hamstring)
- Dribbling too high
- Shuffling feet
- Palming the ball
- Moving body around the ball

## Progression Levels

| Level | Target |
|-------|--------|
| Beginner | 20 reps per move, single moves only |
| Intermediate | Full rep structure including combinations |
| Advanced | Add two-ball dribbling (same moves, both balls simultaneously) |
