# Pickup Shooting (Off-the-Dribble)

> Source: Curry MasterClass, Brandon Payne Offseason Workout

## Overview

The "pickup" is the finishing move of any off-the-dribble shot — the moment the ball comes off the last dribble into your shot pocket. This drill isolates that transition and is **critical for energy transfer from the ground through the shot**, especially when extending to three-point range.

## Why This Matters for Three-Point Energy Transfer

When your mid-range shot feels good but your three feels forced, the problem is usually in the pickup:
- The last dribble isn't hard enough (ball doesn't bounce back to shot pocket height)
- You're reaching down for the ball instead of letting it come to you
- The dribble-to-shot motion isn't seamless, so you lose the kinetic chain from legs through release

## Setup

- **Equipment:** Ball, hoop
- **Court:** Half court
- **Players:** 1

  ============================================

  1 = Close range (~5 ft)  -- start here
  2 = Short range (~8 ft)
  3 = Mid-range  (~14 ft)
  4 = THREE-POINT LINE     -- target distance

  At each distance: 5 perfect makes,
  then step back to the next number.

  Phase 1: Dominant hand pound at all distances
  Phase 2: Off-hand pound at all distances
  Phase 3: Dribble moves into pickup from spot 4
```

## Structure

### Phase 1: Single Pound Dribble (Dominant Hand)

1. Start close to the basket (~5 feet)
2. One HARD pound dribble straight into your shot pocket
3. Rise into your shot — same mechanics as form shooting
4. **Make 5 perfect shots**, then step back one distance
5. Repeat through 4 distances (same as form shooting progression)

### Phase 2: Single Pound Dribble (Off-Hand)

Same structure, but the ball is in your non-dominant hand:
1. Hard pound dribble with left hand (for right-handed shooters)
2. Ball rises to hip level
3. Bring it ACROSS into your shot pocket in one motion
4. **Do NOT reach across your body** with your shooting hand to grab the ball on the off side
5. The ball comes to you at hip level — you bring it across

### Phase 3: Moves Into Pickup

Once you can make 5 perfect in a row from each distance off a single pound:
1. Crossover into pickup shot
2. Between-the-legs into pickup shot
3. Behind-the-back into pickup shot

### Phase 4: Combinations

String 2-3 dribble moves together, then pickup into shot.

## Technique Cues

### The Last Dribble
- Must be **HARD and aggressive** — this is the key to energy transfer
- Ball bounces to about waist height on its own
- Comes directly into your shot pocket
- You should NOT be reaching down for the ball — the hard pound brings it to you
- Ball should be just outside your knee on the pound

### The Shot
- Eyes locked on the rim, never on the ball
- One continuous motion from dribble to shot
- Same mechanics as form shooting — legs drive the power
- Hold your follow-through

### Energy Transfer Chain
1. Hard pound dribble (ball hits floor with force)
2. Ball bounces back to waist/shot pocket height
3. Simultaneously, you're driving through your legs (loading hips)
4. Ball arrives in shot pocket as you begin your upward motion
5. Legs, core, and arms all fire in sequence — ground up

## Diagnosing Energy Transfer Issues

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Three-point shots fall short | Not using legs / upper-body-only shooting | Load hips deeper, drive through the ground |
| Ball arrives late to shot pocket | Pound dribble too soft | Pound HARDER — ball should rocket back up |
| Reaching down for ball | Dribble not aggressive enough | Let the hard dribble bring the ball to you |
| Shot feels rushed from three | Breaking the kinetic chain | One continuous motion — don't pause between dribble and shot |
| Ball path feels off | Picking up from wrong position | Ball should be just outside your knee |

| Intermediate | Both hands, all distances through three-point line, single moves into pickup |
| Advanced | Combination moves into pickup, game-speed execution |
