# Catch-and-Shoot with Footwork

> Source: Curry MasterClass Parts 1 & 2

## Overview

Add movement and footwork to your catch-and-shoot. This bridges the gap between stationary form shooting and game-speed shooting where you're always moving before receiving the ball.

## Setup

- **Equipment:** Ball, hoop
- **Court:** Half court
- **Players:** 1 (use self-toss) or 2 (with a passer/rebounder)

## Structure: Four-Way Shooting

From each spot on the floor, shoot 5 perfect makes from each direction of movement:

### Direction 1: Stationary
- 5 straight up-and-down shots (no movement)

### Direction 2: Moving Toward the Basket
- Start a step behind your shooting spot
- Step forward into the catch, rise into the shot
- 5 makes

### Direction 3: Moving Away from the Basket
- Start a step closer than your shooting spot
- Step backward into the catch, rise into the shot
- Keep nose behind toes — don't lean forward
- 5 makes

### Direction 4: Moving Laterally
- Shuffle step to your shooting spot from each side
- Keep hips and shoulders in a straight line
- Move purely lateral — do NOT drift toward the basket or toward the defender
- 5 makes from each side

## Court Spots

Work from at least 3 spots:
1. Right wing (mid-range, then three-point)
2. Top of the key (mid-range, then three-point)
3. Left wing (mid-range, then three-point)

## Technique Cues

### Pre-Catch
- Be shot-ready BEFORE the ball arrives
- Show 10 fingers to your passer (hands up and out, not hanging)
- Feet moving into position, body squared to the basket

### The Catch
- Catch at the level the ball arrives
- Don't drop the ball more than 1-2 inches before going into your shot
- Ball travels in a straight line up into shot pocket

### Footwork
- 1-2 step gather: as soon as the second foot hits the ground, go straight up
- Drive through the ground, straight up and down
- Heels should not touch the ground
- Stay vertical — don't hinge over
- Land in a balanced position

### Lateral Movement Specifics
- Keep nose in center of body
- Hard dribble, but don't speed up just because you're moving
- Hips and shoulders stay in a straight line
- Don't whip body or head

### Adapting to Bad Passes (Self-Toss Misses)
- Pass off to the side: move your BODY to the ball (side-step), don't just reach
- Pass too low: drop your hips lower while staying in shot-ready position
- Always: 10 fingers, 10 toes to the rim

## Progression Levels

| Level | Target |
|-------|--------|
| Beginner | Stationary + 1 direction, mid-range only |
| Intermediate | All 4 directions, mid-range and three-point line |
| Advanced | All 4 directions at game speed, add self-toss variability |

## Key Principle

> "Your mechanics stay exactly the same. You're just adding the footwork."
