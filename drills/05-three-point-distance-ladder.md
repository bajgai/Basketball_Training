# Three-Point Distance Ladder

> Source: Brandon Payne Offseason Workout

## Overview

A shooting ladder that cycles through three distances — deep mid-range, three-point line, and deep three — from mirrored spots on the floor. This trains your body to adjust power output shot-to-shot, which is exactly what fixes energy transfer issues at the three-point line.

## Setup

- **Equipment:** Ball, hoop
- **Court:** Half court
- **Players:** 1

## Structure

### Three Distances (per spot)

1. **Deep two** — 1-2 feet inside the three-point line
2. **Three-pointer** — right at the three-point line
3. **Deep three** — 2-3 feet behind the three-point line

### Shot Pattern

From each spot, shoot one from each distance, then move to the mirrored spot on the other side:

1. Right wing: deep two → three → deep three
2. Left wing: deep two → three → deep three
3. Right corner: deep two → three → deep three
4. Left corner: deep two → three → deep three
5. Top of the key: deep two → three → deep three

**Never work the same side of the floor consecutively.** Wing to wing, corner to corner, then top.

### Reps

- 1 shot from each distance at each spot = 15 shots per round
- Run 3-4 rounds = **45-60 total shots**
- Every shot should have a couple of variables compared to the previous one

## Technique Cues

### Adjusting Power for Distance
- The ONLY thing that changes between distances is how deep you load your hips
- Deeper hip load = more leg power = longer shot
- Arm mechanics, release point, and arc stay IDENTICAL
- If you're muscling the ball from three, you're not using your legs enough

### Mirrored Footwork
- Whatever footwork you use on the right side, repeat it on the left
- This builds symmetry and prevents favoring one side

### Self-Toss for Solo Work
- Toss the ball out with backspin to the spot
- Move to catch position
- Catch and shoot with proper footwork

## Why This Fixes Energy Transfer

The ladder forces your body to constantly recalibrate power output:
- After a deep two, a regular three feels natural (small increase)
- After a deep three, a regular three feels easy (you've already loaded more)
- Your body learns the **feel** of each distance through contrast
