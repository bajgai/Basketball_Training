# Consecutive Makes Game

> Source: Brandon Payne Offseason Workout

## Overview

A pressure shooting drill where you must make consecutive shots from each of five spots before moving on. The consecutive requirement descends each round, and you run between rounds to keep your heart rate elevated. This simulates game-condition shooting where you rarely shoot while rested.

## Setup

- **Equipment:** Ball, hoop
- **Court:** Half court
- **Players:** 1

## The 5 Spots

1. Right corner (three-point line)
2. Right wing (three-point line)
3. Top of the key (three-point line)
4. Left wing (three-point line)
5. Left corner (three-point line)

## Structure

### Round 1: 3 Consecutive Makes
- At each spot, make **3 shots in a row** before moving to the next
- If you miss, reset the count at that spot
- Move through all 5 spots

### Round 2: 2 Consecutive Makes
- Between rounds: sprint to half court and back
- At each spot, make **2 shots in a row**
- Move through all 5 spots

### Round 3: 1 Make per Spot (Star Pattern)
- Between rounds: sprint to half court and back
- **1 make** at each spot, moving quickly between spots
- This round is about rhythm — constant movement, no stopping

## Why Elevated Heart Rate Matters

> "Low heart rate shooting doesn't translate very well to game conditions." — Brandon Payne

In games, you're never standing still and rested before a shot. Sprinting between rounds ensures you're practicing shooting while fatigued, which is how you'll actually shoot in games.

## Technique Cues

- Focus on mechanics even when tired — this is when form breaks down
- Rushed shots are not the goal; controlled shots under fatigue IS the goal
- If your body is breaking down mechanically, slow the pace slightly but don't abandon form
- Track total time — try to beat your previous session

## Adaptation for Half Court (No Full Court Sprint)

Since you have a half court:
- Sprint sideline to sideline (2x) between rounds
- OR do 10 fast defensive slides across the lane between rounds
- The goal is simply to elevate heart rate before the next round

## Progression Levels

| Level | Target |
|-------|--------|
| Beginner | 2-1 (skip the 3-consecutive round), mid-range spots |
| Intermediate | 3-2-1 from the three-point line |
| Advanced | 4-3-2-1 from the three-point line (Curry's version) |

## Curry's Benchmark

In the offseason workout video, Curry completed the full 4-3-2-1 version and beat his target time by approximately 30 seconds, while interleaving a transition shooting game ("21") between rounds.
