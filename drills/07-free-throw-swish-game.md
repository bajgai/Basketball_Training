  ============================================

  [X] = Free throw line (15 ft from basket)

  Goal: 6 consecutive SWISHES from this spot.
  No rim contact allowed on any of the 6.
```

## Structure

### The Challenge

Make **6 free throws in a row** where **none of the 6 touch the rim** (all swishes).

- If any shot touches the rim, restart the count
- If you miss, restart the count
- Continue until you complete 6 consecutive swishes

## Technique Cues

- Same form shooting mechanics — nothing changes
- Focus on a soft, high-arc release
- Target: front hooks of the rim (same as all shooting)
- The swish requirement naturally encourages proper arc (45-48 degrees)
- This is a focus/concentration drill as much as a shooting drill
- Breathe — don't rush

## Why Swishes Matter

A swish means:
- Perfect arc
- Perfect alignment (no left-right deviation)
- Perfect touch (ball enters the basket on a downward trajectory through the center)

If you can swish free throws consistently, your mechanics are dialed in.
