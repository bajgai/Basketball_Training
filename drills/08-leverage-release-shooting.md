# Leverage Release Shooting

> Source: Brandon Payne Offseason Workout

## Overview

A drill that trains shooting after creating space from a defender. Since you don't have a training partner to provide physical leverage, this is adapted as a **self-directed spacing drill** — practicing the footwork and balance of stepping away from an imaginary defender into a shot.

## Setup

- **Equipment:** Ball, hoop
- **Court:** Half court
- **Players:** 1

## Structure

### Variation A: Lateral Release (Side-Step)

1. Start at a spot on the three-point line
2. Imagine a defender on your inside hip
3. Side-step laterally (1-2 steps) to create space
4. Catch yourself in a balanced position
5. Rise into your shot

**5 makes from each side at each spot.**

### Variation B: Straight-Back Release (Step-Back)

1. Start a step inside the three-point line (as if you were driving)
2. Plant and step straight back to the three-point line
3. Regain balance
4. Rise into your shot

**5 makes from each spot.**

## Court Spots

1. Right wing
2. Top of the key
3. Left wing

## Technique Cues

### Alignment Check
- The line between your **nose and belly button** must stay aimed at the rim
- After the side-step or step-back, check this alignment before shooting
- Do NOT allow lateral flexion in the core (torso bending sideways)

### Balance on Step-Back
- **Ears over shoulders, shoulders over hips**
- Don't get your chest too far out in front of your toes — this causes overcorrection and long shots
- The step-back should feel controlled, not like you're falling away

### The Shot
- Once balanced, the shot is identical to form shooting
- Quicker, easier, more controlled shot results from proper alignment
- Hold follow-through

## Self-Correction Drill

If you notice your shots drifting to one side after the lateral release:
1. Stop shooting
2. Put your fists together in front of your chest
3. Resist rotational force (twist your fists against each other)
4. This engages your anti-rotation muscles
5. Return to the drill — the drift should improve
