## Drill 1: Form Shooting Progression

```
Clean overhead view of a basketball half-court diagram in a modern sports coaching playbook style. The court has a warm hardwood floor with crisp white lines. Five shooting angles radiate outward from the basket like a fan: right baseline, right wing, top of the key, left wing, and left corner. Along each angle, four small glowing dots mark shooting distances — the closest dot is right at the rim, each one stepping further back to about 15 feet. The dots graduate in color from green (closest) to yellow to orange to red (farthest). Small curved arrows connect the dots along each angle showing the progression outward. A bold label at the top reads "FORM SHOOTING PROGRESSION." Clean, minimal, flat design with subtle shadows. No people. Instructional sports infographic style.

## Drill 2: Stationary Ball Handling

```
A clean instructional illustration showing a basketball player in proper athletic dribbling stance, viewed from the front at a slight low angle. The player is silhouetted in dark navy blue against a light warm background. Key body alignment cues are highlighted with thin white annotation lines: "EYES UP" pointing to the head looking forward, "NOSE CENTERED" with a vertical dotted line down the center of the body, "HIPS LOADED" at the hip crease showing a slight squat, "KNEES BEHIND TOES" at the knees, and "BALL BETWEEN KNEE AND HIP" showing a basketball at the correct dribble height just outside the right foot. The feet are shoulder-width apart with a label "SHOULDER WIDTH." Modern sports coaching diagram style, clean flat design with subtle depth. Title at top: "BALL HANDLING STANCE."

## Drill 3: Pickup Shooting (Energy Transfer)

```
Overhead view of a basketball half-court in a modern coaching diagram style on warm hardwood. A single shooting lane extends from directly under the basket straight out to beyond the three-point arc. Four numbered zones are marked along this lane: zone 1 glowing green at the rim, zone 2 in yellow at 8 feet, zone 3 in orange at the free-throw line area, and zone 4 in red at the three-point line. A bold dashed arrow runs from zone 1 outward to zone 4 showing the progression direction. At zone 4, three smaller branching arrows show different approach angles labeled "CROSSOVER," "BETWEEN LEGS," and "BEHIND BACK." A small inset diagram in the corner shows the energy transfer sequence: a downward arrow labeled "HARD POUND" hitting the floor, then an upward arrow labeled "INTO SHOT POCKET." Title: "PICKUP SHOOTING — ENERGY TRANSFER." Clean sports infographic, flat design, no people.

## Drill 4: Catch-and-Shoot with Footwork

```
Overhead view of a basketball half-court diagram, modern coaching playbook style on warm hardwood with crisp white lines. Three shooting spots are marked on the court as bright circles: right wing, top of the key, and left wing — all at three-point distance. At each spot, four directional arrows extend outward like a compass rose: one arrow pointing toward the basket labeled with a small "T" (toward), one pointing away labeled "A" (away), and two pointing sideways labeled "L" (lateral). The arrows are color-coded: blue for toward, red for away, green for lateral. The three-point arc and the paint are clearly visible. A small legend in the corner explains: "T = Toward basket, A = Away from basket, L = Lateral shuffle." Title: "CATCH-AND-SHOOT — 4 DIRECTIONS." Clean, minimal sports infographic. No people.

## Drill 5: Three-Point Distance Ladder

```
Overhead view of a basketball half-court diagram, clean modern coaching style on warm hardwood. Five shooting locations are marked around the three-point arc: right corner, right wing, top of key, left wing, left corner. At each location, three concentric dots are stacked at increasing distances from the basket: an inner green dot just inside the three-point line labeled "DEEP 2," a middle yellow dot right on the three-point line labeled "3PT," and an outer red dot two feet behind the line labeled "DEEP 3." A numbered path with arrows connects the five locations in a zigzag mirror pattern: right corner to left corner, right wing to left wing, then top of key — showing you never shoot from the same side twice in a row. Title: "THREE-POINT DISTANCE LADDER." Clean flat sports infographic, no people.

## Drill 6: Consecutive Makes Game

```
Overhead view of a basketball half-court diagram, bold modern coaching style on warm hardwood. Five bright numbered circles sit along the three-point arc: 1 at right corner, 2 at right wing, 3 at top of key, 4 at left wing, 5 at left corner. A solid arrow path connects them in order from 1 through 5 showing the shooting sequence. Between the court and the sideline, a red zigzag arrow labeled "SPRINT" shows the sideline-to-sideline run between rounds. Three round badges along the bottom show the descending structure: a large "3" badge labeled "Round 1: 3 in a row," a medium "2" badge labeled "Round 2: 2 in a row," and a small "1" badge labeled "Round 3: 1 each (star pattern)." For the star pattern, faint dashed lines connect spots 1-3-5-2-4 in a star shape. Title: "CONSECUTIVE MAKES GAME." Clean sports infographic, no people.

## Drill 7: Free Throw Swish Game

```
A dramatic front view of a basketball hoop from the free-throw line perspective, looking up at the rim and net. The image is stylized in a clean, modern sports aesthetic with warm gym lighting. The net hangs perfectly still. A basketball is captured mid-flight in a high arc, about to enter the basket dead center — a perfect swish trajectory. A thin dotted line traces the ball's 45-degree arc from the shooter's release point to the center of the hoop. The rim hooks where the net attaches are subtly highlighted with a small glowing circle labeled "TARGET: THE HOOKS." At the bottom of the frame, the text reads "THE SWISH GAME — 6 consecutive, no rim." Cinematic sports photography feel, shallow depth of field, warm golden gym lighting.

## Drill 8: Leverage Release Shooting

```
Overhead view of a basketball half-court diagram, clean modern coaching style on warm hardwood. Three shooting spots are marked at three-point distance: right wing, top of key, left wing. At each spot, two types of movement are shown:

LATERAL RELEASE: Two horizontal arrows extend left and right from the spot, each ending in a small shoe-print icon and a basketball icon showing where you land and shoot. The arrows are blue.

STEP-BACK RELEASE: A single arrow points from a position inside the three-point line backward to the three-point line, colored in orange. A small "S" marks the starting position inside the arc, and the shooting position is on the arc.

A small inset in the corner shows a side-view silhouette demonstrating proper alignment with a vertical line through "EARS — SHOULDERS — HIPS" and the label "STAY STACKED." Title: "LEVERAGE RELEASE — CREATE SPACE INTO SHOT." Clean sports infographic, flat design, no people.

## Tips for Best Results

- **Run each prompt one at a time** in Gemini
- If the text labels don't render well, try a follow-up prompt: "Make the text labels clearer and larger"
- If you want a consistent style across all 8, add this to the end of every prompt: "Match the style of the previous basketball drill diagram I generated."
- To get a version without text overlays (for adding your own later): append "Remove all text labels, keep only the visual diagram"
- Aspect ratio: these work best at **16:9 landscape** for court diagrams, **4:5 portrait** for the stance diagram (Drill 2) and the swish game (Drill 7)
