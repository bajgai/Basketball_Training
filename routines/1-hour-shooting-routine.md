# 1-Hour Shooting Routine (Curry-Based)

> Tailored for: Intermediate player | Half court | Ball + hoop only
> Focus area: Three-point energy transfer

---

## Player Profile

- **Level:** Intermediate — solid mid-range, three-point shot exists but energy transfer feels off
- **Court:** Half court
- **Equipment:** Basketball and hoop (no cones, chair, or rebounder)
- **Core issue:** Power isn't flowing efficiently from legs through the shot at three-point distance

## The Fix (Why This Routine Is Structured This Way)

Your mid-range shot works because at that distance, even partial leg engagement produces enough power. At the three-point line, you need the **full kinetic chain** — legs, hips, core, arm — firing in sequence. When energy transfer breaks down, shooters compensate by muscling the ball with their arms, which kills accuracy and consistency.

This routine rebuilds your shot from the ground up every session, then progressively extends to three-point range so your body learns to generate power correctly at every distance.

## The Routine

### Phase 1: Warm-Up & Activation (8 min)

#### Ball Handling — 3 min
> [Drill: Stationary Ball Handling Foundation](../drills/02-stationary-ball-handling.md)

- 20 crossovers (10 each direction)
- 20 between-the-legs (10 each direction)
- 20 behind-the-back (10 each direction)
- Then string them together: 6 of each → 2 of each → 1 of each

**Focus:** Hard, aggressive dribbles. Eyes up. Nose centered. This wakes up your hands and gets you in an athletic stance.

#### Form Shooting (Close Range) — 5 min
> [Drill: Form Shooting Progression](../drills/01-form-shooting-progression.md)

- 5 angles around the basket
- **2 distances only** (at the rim + short range)
- 5 makes per distance = **50 makes**
- Use self-toss (toss ball out with backspin, catch, shoot)

**Focus:** See the ball go in. Calibrate your mechanics. Check: 10 toes to the rim, hips loaded, ball on fingertip pads, eyes on the hooks, gooseneck follow-through.

---

### Phase 2: Pickup Shooting — Energy Transfer Focus (12 min)

> [Drill: Pickup Shooting](../drills/03-pickup-shooting.md)

This is your **most important phase**. This is where you fix the three-point energy transfer.

#### Step 1: Dominant Hand Pickup (5 min)
- Start at the rim (~5 feet)
- One HARD pound dribble → ball rockets into shot pocket → shoot
- 5 makes, step back
- Work through 4 distances: rim → short → mid-range → **three-point line**

**The key:** That last dribble must be VIOLENT. The ball should bounce back to waist height on its own. You should NOT be reaching down for it. The hard pound is what connects your legs to your shot.

#### Step 2: Off-Hand Pickup (3 min)
- Same progression but ball starts in your left hand
- Hard pound with left → ball rises to hip → bring across into shot pocket
- Do NOT reach across your body — let the ball come to you
- Work from close range to mid-range

#### Step 3: Moves Into Pickup (4 min)
- From the three-point line:
  - 3 makes: crossover → pickup shot
  - 3 makes: between-the-legs → pickup shot
  - 3 makes: behind-the-back → pickup shot
- Each shot starts with a hard dribble move, finishes with a hard pound into the shot

---

### Phase 3: Catch-and-Shoot with Footwork (10 min)

> [Drill: Catch-and-Shoot Footwork](../drills/04-catch-and-shoot-footwork.md)

#### From Mid-Range (5 min)
At 3 spots (right wing, top of key, left wing):
- 3 makes stationary
- 3 makes moving toward the basket
- 3 makes moving away
- 3 makes moving laterally

Use self-toss to simulate the pass.

#### From Three-Point Line (5 min)
Same 3 spots, same 4 directions:
- 2 makes from each direction at each spot

**Focus:** Be shot-ready BEFORE the ball arrives. Show 10 fingers. 1-2 step gather — as soon as the second foot hits, go straight up. Don't rush the lateral shots.

---

### Phase 4: Three-Point Distance Ladder (12 min)

> [Drill: Three-Point Distance Ladder](../drills/05-three-point-distance-ladder.md)

This phase teaches your body to **feel** the difference between distances and automatically adjust power output.

#### Structure
From each of 5 spots, shoot one at each distance:
1. Deep two (1-2 feet inside the line)
2. Three-pointer (at the line)
3. Deep three (2-3 feet behind the line)

**Pattern:** Right wing → Left wing → Right corner → Left corner → Top of key

Run 3 full rounds = **45 shots**

**Focus:** The ONLY thing that changes between distances is how deep you load your hips. Deeper load = more power. Your arm mechanics, release, and arc stay identical. If you're muscling the deep three with your arms, you need to sit deeper into your hips.

---

### Phase 5: Consecutive Makes Game — Game Pressure (12 min)

> [Drill: Consecutive Makes Game](../drills/06-consecutive-makes-game.md)

Now you shoot under pressure with an elevated heart rate.

#### Round 1: 3 Consecutive Makes
- From each of 5 spots on the three-point line
- Must make 3 in a row before moving to the next spot
- Miss = reset count at that spot

**Sprint:** After completing Round 1, sprint sideline to sideline (2x)

#### Round 2: 2 Consecutive Makes
- Same 5 spots
- 2 in a row at each

**Sprint:** Sideline to sideline (2x)

#### Round 3: 1 Make per Spot (Star Pattern)
- 1 make at each spot, moving quickly
- No stopping between spots — constant motion

**Focus:** This is where your improved energy transfer gets tested. You're tired, your heart rate is up, and you have to make shots. Maintain form. Don't muscle it. Trust your legs.

### Phase 6: Cool-Down — Free Throws & Quality Shots (6 min)

#### Free Throw Swish Game (3 min)
> [Drill: Free Throw Swish Game](../drills/07-free-throw-swish-game.md)

- Goal: 4 consecutive swished free throws (no rim contact)
- If any shot touches the rim, restart the count
- This resets your focus and touch after the high-intensity phase

#### Quality Finishing Shots (3 min)
- Pick 2 spots on the floor (your favorite spots)
- Make 5 consecutive shots from each
- These must be **perfect makes** — not just "went in" but mechanically clean

> "Your body always remembers the last 20-30 shots you take." — Brandon Payne

End your workout with shots that feel right. If a make didn't feel clean, don't count it.

## Progress Tracking

Track these numbers each session to measure improvement:

1. **Phase 4 — Distance Ladder:** How many three-pointers made out of 15 attempts (3 rounds x 5 spots)?
2. **Phase 5 — Consecutive Makes:** Total time to complete all 3 rounds
3. **Phase 6 — Swish Game:** How many attempts to get 4 consecutive swishes?

> "Don't compare yourself to others. Compare yourself to yourself — how many makes today versus yesterday?" — Stephen Curry

## Key Principles to Remember

1. **Shoot from the ground up.** Legs provide the power, arms provide the direction.
2. **Aim small, miss small.** Pick a specific spot on the rim (the hooks), not "the hoop."
3. **The last dribble must be hard.** This is the bridge between your legs and your shot.
4. **Ears over shoulders, shoulders over hips.** Stay stacked and balanced.
5. **Not all makes are good makes.** A shot that went in with bad form is a "miss that just went in."
6. **Misses give you information.** Left/right = mechanical problem. Short/long = power/touch issue.
7. **Never let fatigue change your mechanics.** Take a break rather than practicing bad form.
8. **Your body remembers the last 20-30 shots.** Always end with quality.
